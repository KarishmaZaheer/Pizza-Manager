# Pizza-Manager
Our Pizza management system will permit our users to deal with an online menu rapidly and effectively, clients can put orders with only a few clicks.
In today’s time the Food Industry has been a go to thing for everyone as nobody can live without fancy food, fast food, or any kind of food. Earlier the trend of dinning out was one of the main things but in today’s time online ordering system and home deliveries has taken over it. In this documentation we are representing the online ordering system which is primarily used in the Food Chain.
The system then forwards it to the employees for the further processing. It saves time, it provides more visual confirmations regarding orders, it is more efficient than taking orders via calls. The principal benefit of our system is that it incredibly improves on the requesting interaction for both the customer and the café. In our system we have given some options for our customers to choose from, for example about the pizza topping or flavors, the fractional amount, and here a customer can sort it by calories, price, or size. The need that triggered us to develop this project is that due to current situation it is forbidden for
everyone to step out unnecessarily, so we developed this system to help and make everyone enjoy their food by staying at home.
